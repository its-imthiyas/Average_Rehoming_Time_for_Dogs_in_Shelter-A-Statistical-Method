# Average Rehoming Time for Dogs in Shelter - A Statistical Method
A Statistical approach using R to find the average Rehoming time for Dogs in Shelter

## Objective:
Dogs that are stray, unwanted or neglected are often sent to animal shelters to be
rehomed. An important outcome for each dog is the time taken to rehome them. Previous
research has suggested that, on average, it takes around **27** weeks to rehome a dog,
with a variance of around **74**. The author of that research believes that this average
applies to all breeds of dog.

However, other researchers believe that the average time taken to rehome dogs
depends strongly on their breed and will differ from 27 weeks for some breeds. The goal is to investigate this by analysing a sample consisting of three different breeds of dog.
